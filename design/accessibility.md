# Accessibility Design Guidelines

## 1. Colors and Contrast
### Guidelines:
- **Minimum Contrast Ratio**: Text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background. For large text (18pt or larger, or 14pt bold), a ratio of 3:1 is acceptable.
- **Avoid Color as the Sole Indicator**: Do not rely solely on color to convey information. Use text, patterns, or icons as additional indicators.
- **Colorblindness Simulation**: Test designs with colorblindness simulators to ensure accessibility for users with color vision deficiencies.

### Tools:

- [Colorblind Simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/)

## 2. Text and Typography
### Guidelines:
- **Font Size**: Use at least 16px for body text to ensure readability.
- **Heading Hierarchy**: Structure content with proper headings (H1, H2, H3) to aid screen readers and navigation.
- **Alt Text**: Provide descriptive alt text for all non-decorative images and icons.
- **Spacing**: Maintain adequate spacing with line-height (1.5x font size) and letter spacing for easier reading.

### Best Practices:
- Use plain language for clarity.
- Avoid justified text alignment to prevent uneven spacing.

## 3. Navigation
### Guidelines:
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard (e.g., tab, enter, arrow keys).
- **Focus Indicators**: Highlight the currently focused element with a visible outline or other visual indicators.
- **Descriptive Links**: Use meaningful link text (e.g., "Learn More About Accessibility" instead of "Click Here").

- [Focus Indicator Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G195.html)

## 4. Interactive Elements
### Guidelines:
- **Clickable Area**: Ensure interactive elements have a minimum target size of 44x44px.
- **Feedback**: Provide visual or auditory feedback for user actions, such as button presses or form submissions.
- **Time Limits**: Avoid strict time limits for interactions, or provide a way to extend time when necessary.

### Best Practices:
- Avoid overly complex gestures or controls that may hinder usability for some users.

---

## 5. Media and Animations
### Guidelines:
- **Text Alternatives**: Provide transcripts for audio content and captions for videos.
- **Media Controls**: Ensure users can play, pause, stop, or control the volume of media content.
- **Animation Settings**: Allow users to disable or reduce animations, especially for motion-sensitive individuals.

### Tools:
- [Able Player](https://ableplayer.github.io/)
- System settings for reduced motion (e.g., macOS or Windows).

---

## 6. Forms
### Guidelines:
- **Labels**: Associate every input field with a visible and descriptive label.
- **Error Messages**: Display clear error messages and provide guidance for correction.
- **Accessible Validation**: Use ARIA roles and states to make validation errors detectable by assistive technologies.

### Best Practices:
- Group related fields with fieldsets and legends.
- Indicate required fields clearly.

---

## 7. Language and Content
### Guidelines:
- **Simple Language**: Use clear and concise language to make content understandable for a broad audience.
- **Document Language**: Define the language of the page (e.g., `lang="en"` for English) to assist screen readers.
- **Consistent Navigation**: Ensure menus and navigational elements are consistent across pages.

---

## 8. Responsiveness
### Guidelines:
- **Flexible Layouts**: Design for responsiveness across different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Scalable Content**: Ensure that text and elements scale appropriately without breaking functionality or layout.
- **Touchscreen Accessibility**: Optimize interactive elements for touchscreens with sufficient spacing.

### Tools:
- [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/)
- Browser developer tools.

---

## 9. Standards and Testing
### Guidelines:
- **WCAG Compliance**: Adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at level AA or higher.
- **User Testing**: Test with users who have disabilities to identify real-world issues.
- **Automated Testing**: Use tools to catch common accessibility issues.

### Tools:
- [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)
- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)

---

## 10. Documentation and Collaboration
### Guidelines:
- **Internal Documentation**: Maintain accessibility guidelines for designers and developers.
- **Team Training**: Provide training to ensure the team understands accessibility principles.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct periodic audits to ensure ongoing compliance.
